When the program is executed with a number of arguments not equal to one, it begins by duplicating the file associated with file descriptor 2 (standard error) using the dup(2) system call. It then checks the access modes and flags of the new descriptor using fcntl, which confirms that it is opened in read-write mode. Following this setup, the program writes an error message to the duplicated descriptor: "Error. The program should receive a single argument. Exiting." Interestingly, this message is immediately followed by a "Success" message. Finally, the program terminates by calling exit_group(0), exiting with status code 0.
